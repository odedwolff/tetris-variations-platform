"# tetris-variations-platform" 



This project was born following an idea that i've had to cross tetris with scrabble. I have done a brief research to see if anyone had had the 
same idead prior to me. I didn't find anything. only after putting some good hours into it did I discover that my earlier research missed 
someone else that did ideed though about this earlier (I doubt that he has had any major commercial success). 
hopefully the effort will not go completely to waste, and this could be used for some other tetris variations.
